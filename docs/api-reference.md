# API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8787`

## Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/health
```

Returns memory counts, freshness, trust, coverage, contradiction count, and aggregate health score.

## Create Memory

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/memories \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "dev",
    "content": "Project Atlas uses TypeScript for all harness components.",
    "source": {"kind": "human", "confidence": 0.96},
    "tags": ["project", "typescript"]
  }'
```

## List Memories

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8787/memories?userId=dev"
```

## Search

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/search \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "dev", "query": "What language should Atlas use?", "limit": 5}'
```

Search results include ranked memories, signal breakdowns, citations, and stale flags.

## Reflection

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/reflection \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "dev"}'
```

Reflection clusters repeated themes, creates summaries, demotes contradictions, fades stale low-utility memories, reorganizes procedural memories, and returns a `lifecycle` report.

## Dream Cycle

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/dream \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "dev"}'
```

`/dream` is an alias for the full maintenance cycle. Use the word `dream` for scheduled background maintenance and `reflection` for explicit user-triggered cleanup. Both return:

- `created`: new reflection summaries,
- `demoted`: memories whose trust or lifecycle state changed,
- `contradictions`: lower-quality claims superseded by stronger evidence,
- `lifecycle`: evaluated, summarized, faded, archived, reorganized, quality score, issues, and actions.

## Maintenance

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/maintenance
```

Returns automatic dream-cycle policy and per-user counters.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/maintenance/dream-due
```

Runs dreams for every due user and returns `dreamedUsers`.
